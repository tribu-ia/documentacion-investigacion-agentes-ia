# Potpie AI Documentation

## Introduction

Potpie AI is an innovative coding agent platform designed to streamline software development by offering both pre-built and custom-built agents for various coding tasks. Its **Prompt-to-Agent** approach empowers users to create specialized agents tailored to their team's context and specific needs.

## Initial Classification

### Category: Coding Agent 
### Implementation Level: High Level 
###  Target Audience: Developers and Engineering Teams

**Explanation:** Potpie AI offers ready-to-use AI agents for coding tasks like code review, testing, and design. This positions it as a high-level solution designed for developers and teams who need to leverage AI to automate and improve their coding workflows.

## Key Capabilities

* **Deep Codebase Understanding:** Potpie AI can analyze and understand your codebases across various languages, enabling it to generate more accurate and relevant results.
* **Multi-Language Support:**  Supports a wide range of programming languages, making it adaptable to different projects. 
* **Pre-Built Agents:** Offers pre-trained agents for common coding tasks such as Low Level Design (LLD), testing, and code review.
* **Custom Agent Building:**  Users can leverage the "Prompt-to-Agent" feature to build their own specialized agents for unique use cases.
* **Seamless Integration:**  Designed to integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows and tools.

## Technical Architecture

Potpie AI's architecture is based on a sophisticated combination of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and code understanding capabilities. It utilizes advanced models trained on vast datasets of code and documentation to understand code structure, patterns, and best practices.  

**Core Components:**

* **Agent Engine:**  Processes user prompts, selects the appropriate agent (pre-built or custom), and executes the requested task.
* **Code Analyzer:** Analyzes codebases to understand their structure, syntax, and functionality.
* **Language Models:**  Processes natural language prompts and translates them into actionable code instructions.
* **Code Generation Module:**  Generates code, tests, documentation, and other outputs based on the agent's instructions. 

**Dependencies:**

* Potpie AI likely relies on open-source libraries for NLP, ML, and code analysis. 
* The specific dependencies may vary depending on the chosen agent or custom agent configuration.

**Interaction Model:**

Potpie AI primarily interacts through natural language prompts, allowing users to communicate their coding tasks in a straightforward manner. It also uses code as input and outputs code, documentation, or analysis reports based on the task at hand.

## Use Cases

**Onboarding Agent:**  New team members can use this agent to understand existing codebases and get answers to questions about how the code works, how to run it, or how specific features are implemented.

**Unit and Integration Test Agent:**  This agent can help generate test plans and test code for new or existing code, ensuring code quality and reducing the risk of bugs.

**Code Changes Agent:**  Developers can use this agent to get functional reviews of their code changes, including potential impact and blast radius.

**Low Level Design (LLD) Agent:**  This agent helps translate feature requirements into detailed LLD documentation, clarifying the implementation approach before coding begins.

**Code Generation Agent:**  Leveraging LLD documentation, this agent can assist in generating actual code changes based on the defined design.

## Implementation Guide
